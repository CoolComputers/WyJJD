"2. Status figures are cases petitioned for fiscal year 2013."
"3. Dependency figures are abuse and/or neglect petitions and Department of Family Services termination of parental rights petitions for fiscal year 2013."
"4. Carbon FY13 stats unable to be verified because of WYUSER implementation, actual total is probably greater."
