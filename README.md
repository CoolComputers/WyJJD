Wyoming Juvenile Justice Data Report  

By using data compiled from various state and federal agencies this project aims to provide valuable insights into the
Juvenile Justice system of the State of Wyoming. This interactive web-based report has been developed to help provide
those who are involved in the Juvenile Justice system with easy to read depictions of standard data points so that they
may make even more informed decisions to assist our youth.
